# GiftCard
This repo contains code that operates as a gift card. It initializes attributes of a GiftCard class and deducts an amount from an initial balance like what would happen when using a gift card to make a purchase at a store. This code can be helpful for everyone. Most people have received a gift card at some point in their life, so this code can be used to determine the balance that will remain on a gift card after a purchase or if any money needs to be paid after using the gift card.
